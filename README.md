This repo provides a scratch of a Python project. Its purpose is to serve as starting point for
the development of a Python project based on a minimal working structure.

## Covered features

* A preconfigured setup.py file following the suggestions from [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py);
* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) autodocumentation with [autodoc](https://docs-python2readthedocs.readthedocs.io/en/master/code-doc.html);
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) minimal configuration;
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows with minimal configurations for latest Ubuntu, macOS and Windows;
* Tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/);
* Development environment with two options:
    * The classic [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
    * A [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) environment with [conda-devenv](https://github.com/ESSS/conda-devenv) extension
* Hierarchical structure to a python package as suggested by ["The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python"](https://docs.python-guide.org/) (highly recommended reading);
* A [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) configuration scratch;
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to perform git hooks before commits. The following plugins are being used:
    - trailing-whitespace
    - end-of-file-fixer
    - black (default options combined with customized line length to 100 chars per line)
    - blacken-docs
* Coverage of the package with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/).
